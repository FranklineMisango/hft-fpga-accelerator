# FPGA Trading Accelerator  
*Hardware-accelerated low-latency trading infrastructure*  

## Overview  
Open-source Verilog/VHDL components for building FPGA-based trading systems. Implements market data parsing, order book management, and strategy execution with sub-microsecond latency. Designed for Xilinx/Intel FPGAs with PCIe and 10G/100G Ethernet support.  

## Key Features  
### 1. Market Data Processing  
- **Protocol Decoders**: Hardware parsers for FIX/ITCH/OUCH protocols.  
- **Tick-to-Order Book**: Real-time aggregation of price/volume data.  

### 2. Order Management  
- **Order State Machine**: Cancel/replace logic with 16ns latency (simulated).  
- **Risk Controls**: Pre-trade checks (e.g., position limits) in hardware.  

### 3. Strategy Templates  
- **Arbitrage**: Cross-exchange latency optimizations.  
- **TWAP/VWAP**: Time-weighted execution with RTL reference designs.
